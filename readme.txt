--Readme document for *Rubi Valenzuela, *rubiv1@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
Yes, I ignored the warning for potential problems. This is because upon looking at the warning closer, many of them were not accurage.
For example, the alt text I utilized for the image is a correct description, and many of the headings I used were correct. Overall, many of the other issues
were not things things that were essential for the website as they were not visible, etc.


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
It took me 7-8 hours to complete this assignment.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
Some of the online resources I used included:
    - Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/ 
    - MDN: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Cheatsheet 
    - Lorem Ipsum: https://www.lipsum.com/ 
    - ChatGPT: I utilized this to review the assignment directions and simplify the core instructions. I also asked
    for clarification regarding specific tags that I could not remember such as the anchor and linking tags. ChatGPT supplied
    me with the purpose of what the tags do and their proper syntax.
